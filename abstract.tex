This work provides approaches to designing and fabricating soft fluidic elastomer robots.
%
%That is, novel approaches to design, fabrication, kinematic modeling, power, control, and planning as well as extensive experimental evaluations with multiple manipulator prototypes are presented.
%
That is, three viable actuator morphologies composed entirely from soft silicone rubber are explored, and these morphologies are differentiated by their internal channel structure, namely: ribbed, cylindrical, and pleated.
%
Additionally, three distinct casting-based fabrication processes are explored: lamination-based casting, retractable-pin-based casting, and lost-wax-based casting.
%
Furthermore, two ways of fabricating a multiple DOF manipulator are explored: casting the complete manipulator as a whole, and casting single DOF segments with subsequent concatenation.
%
We experimentally validate each soft actuator morphology and fabrication process by creating multiple physical soft manipulator prototypes.

%An approach to closed-loop configuration control is presented using a piecewise constant curvature kinematic model, real-time localization data, and novel fluidic drive cylinders which power actuation.
%%
%Multi-segment forward and inverse kinematic algorithms are developed and combined with the configuration controller to provide reliable task-space position control.
%%
%Building on these developments, a suite of task-space planners are presented to demonstrate new autonomous capabilities from these soft robots such as: (i) tracking a path in free-space, (ii) maneuvering in confined environments, and (iii) grasping and placing objects.
%%
%Extensive evaluations of these capabilities with physical prototypes demonstrate for the first time that manipulation with soft fluidic elastomer robots is viable.
