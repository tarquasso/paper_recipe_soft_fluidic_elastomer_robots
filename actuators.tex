\section{Actuators}
\label{sec:Actuators}
In this section we detail the design and fabrication of three soft fluidic elastomer manipulators.
%
The primary design constraint is that the manipulators should be composed almost entirely from soft materials.
%
The primary functional specification is that these manipulators should integrate into an autonomous manipulation system.
%
That is, they should be capable of performing tasks such as trajectory-following in free space, moving dexterously through confined spaces, and/or grasping and placing objects, all without human intervention.
