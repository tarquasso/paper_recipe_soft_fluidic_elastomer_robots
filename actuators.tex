\section{Actuators}
\label{sec:Actuators}
In this section we detail the design and fabrication of three different soft fluidic elastomer body segments.
%
Each type of body segment can serve as a unit-module for composing different soft robot body morphologies.
%
The primary design constraint is that the actuated body segments should be composed almost entirely from soft materials.
%
The primary functional specification is that these actuated segments should integrate into an autonomous robotic systems.
%
That is, they should be capable of performing tasks such as trajectory-following in free space, moving dexterously through confined spaces, and/or grasping and placing objects, all without human intervention.
