\label{sec:Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Vision %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The goal of this work is to provide and compare multiple actuator morphologies and multiple fabrication processes for realizing soft autonomous fluidic elastomer robots.
%
We experimentally validate these morphologies and processes in the context of extremely soft and highly compliant locomotory robots and manipulators shown in Figure~\ref{fig:intro_new}.

Soft robots exhibit continuum body motion, large scale deformation, and relatively high compliance compared to traditional rigid-bodied robots \citep{trivedi2008soft}.
%
Such characteristics give this class of robots advantages like the ability to mitigate uncertainty with passive compliance \citep{mcmahan2006field}, perform highly dexterous tasks \citep{deimel2014novel}, and exhibit resiliency \citep{tolley2014resilient}.
%
This work provides a recipe for designing and fabricating soft fluidic elastomer actuators and robotic systems.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Challenges %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Challenges}
Recent reviews \citep{trivedi2008soft, trimmer2014journal, lipson2014challenges, majidi2014soft} articulate the challenges associated with creating robots from soft, nonlinear materials.
%
To summaries, current engineering tools are well-suited for rigid-bodied robots and when soft, nonlinear elastic materials are introduced, many of the underlying assumptions of these tools are broken.
%
To create fluidic elastomer robots, we must overcome many technical challenges, many of which have to do with design and fabrication.
%
More specifically, this work addresses the following challenges:
(i) We do not have multi-segment fluidic elastomer locomotory robot nor manipulator designs suitable for automated tasks.
That is, we need to identify appropriate actuator morphologies and ways of assembling these actuators into multi-body robots.
(ii) Consistently reproducing certain properties of soft robots, for example their elasticity or internal channel geometry, is difficult using conventional fabrication techniques.
Accordingly, we must develop fabrication techniques that balance the competing goals of scalability and repeatability with need of complicated features and spatial shape profiles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Approach %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Approach}
%In this work, we demonstrate that autonomous manipulation with soft fluidic elastomer robots is possible.
First, we review relevant soft actuation technology, design tools, and fabrication processes in Section~\ref{sec:Related Work}.
%
Next, we present the design and characterization of three fluidic elastomer actuator morphologies in Section~\ref{sec:Actuators}.
%
These actuator morphologies are differentiated by their internal channel structure, namely: ribbed, cylindrical, and pleated.
%
Next, we provide three alternative fabrication approaches for reliably fabricating soft actuators and multi-segment robots in Section~\ref{sec:Fabrication}.
%
These processes are lamination-based embedded casting, retractable-pin-based casting, and lost-wax-based casting.
%
Then, we briefly discuss alternative approaches to powering these robots in Section~\ref{sec:Power}.
%
And lastly, we demonstrate how the various actuator morphologies and fabrication processes have been used to realize a variety of soft autonomous systems: locomotory fish-like robots in Section~\ref{sec:Locomotion} and robotic manipulation systems in Section~\ref{sec:Manipulators}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Contributions %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Contributions}
%The primary contribution of this work is a novel power and computational control and planning system for 2D fluidic elastomer manipulation that enable grasp-and-place and planned continuous motion in environments with obstacles.
%This work is first to show that planar manipulation with soft fluidic elastomer robots is possible and first to provide an approach for closed-loop control and planning of such manipulators.
Specifically this work makes the following contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Three viable multi-segment robot morphologies that are (i) composed primarily of soft silicone rubber, (ii) powered by fluids, (iii) suitable for automation;
  \item Three fabrication processes for reliably manufacturing these soft fluidic elastomer manipulators;
  %\item The first method for closed-loop configuration control for a soft fluidic elastomer robot consisting of (i) a kinematic model and an algorithm for estimating the manipulator's configuration in real-time, (ii) a novel device for providing continuous, closed-circuit adjustment of the manipulator's fluid, and (iii) a cascaded curvature controller;
%  \item Task-space planning algorithms that solve the IK problem and enable these manipulators to autonomously (i) position their end-effector in free-space, (ii) maneuver in confined environments, and (iii) grasp-and-place objects.
\end{enumerate}
This work significantly extends three previous conference publications: \citep{marchese2014design}, \citep{marchese2014whole}, and \citep{katzschmann2015autonomous} (in revision). %TODO remove if not in revision anymore
